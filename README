# Canvas Test

This application is for messing around with Android's Canvas class. It doesn't do anything useful unless you're a programmer who wants to play around with Canvas.

## Usage
To create a new drawing: 
1. Create a new class that implements the interface foobar.canvastest.drawing.Drawable. This class represents a whole scene\drawing. To keep things neat, you should place this class in the package foobar.canvastest.drawing.scenes.
2. Place all of your drawing code in the Draw(Canvas) method of this class.
3. Tell the application to use this new class for drawing. One way to do that is to put this code in MainCanvasActivity.onCreate(). Assuming your new scene class is called YourScene

    ViewGroup containerView = (ViewGroup)findViewById(R.id.containerView);
    mSurfaceView = new MySurfaceView(this, new YourScene());
    
    containerView.addView(mSurfaceView);
